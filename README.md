# PythonDevcontainer
My python devcontainer template and testing area.

## Tips
- The green >< button in the lower left in vscode has the remote containers menus, such as restarting in a container.
- You can add extensions to devcontainer.json from the extension 'Manage' button.

## Troubleshootingk- Ran into errors accessing /tmp/vsch using non-root user, need to revisit.
